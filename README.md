# README.md

## Dean's Blog

This is a repo to house code and instructions for my personal website. 

This project is intended for me to learn a number of things:

1. Spinning up a non-terrible Golang server

2. Structuring an app and writing more Go code

3. Practice containerising the app

4. Deploying this into production for the internet to consume

5. Get more practice writing (I'd like to capture my thoughts and make them understandable)

6. Get a handle on using some cloud products

### Future Enhancements

1. Get a nice CI/CD pipeline going. I'm keen to get more exposure to Github Actions, so keen to implement these as part of deployments.

2. Try deploy it to AWS. That will be an infra challenge all by itself.

3. Creating a nice-ish frontend. I don't particularly enjoy styling or visual design. But that might be because I am bad at both. It's a useful skill to have.
